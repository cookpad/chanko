Description:
    Stubs out a new unit file with controller and view functions,
    a stylesheet, spec files and default logo image.

    This will generate the unit class template in app/units/,
    a view stub in /app/units/#{unit_name}/views/ ,
    a stylesheet in /app/units/#{unit_name}/stylesheets/ ,
    spec stubs in /app/units/#{unit_name}/spec/ ,
    and the blank logo.png in /app/units/#{unit_name}/images/
    along with a symlink in public/images/units/#{unit_name}

    You will need to add the invoke(:your_unit, :function_name) code in the appropriate places.

Example:
    rails generate chanko sample

    This will create:
        app/units/sample.rb
        app/units/sample/views/show.html.haml
        app/units/sample/stylesheets/sample.scss
        app/units/sample/images/logo.png
        app/units/sample/spec/controllers/sample_controller_spec.rb
        app/units/sample/spec/models/sample_model_spec.rb
        app/units/sample/spec/helper/sample_helper_spec.rb
        public/images/units/sample -> ../../../app/units/sample/images
